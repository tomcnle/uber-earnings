## Before you go online checklist

Before you go online, check your car is in great shape.

1. Re-stock mints
2. Re-stock waters
3. Ensure no-one has left behind rubbish
4. Dust off mats
5. Clean windscreen, windows and door handles
6. Ensure none of your personal belongings are in the way of the rider
7. Make sure you have a full tank of gas, you don't want to go offline to get gas when you're on a roll

Can you think of anything else?
